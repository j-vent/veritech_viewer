This is a site created for Veritech, a student startup that works to automate marking. The site is used by markers to view useful information by filtering by student ID and/or date. It features a records page to view student work per session, showing details of each booklet down to the question. The gradeboook allows markers to add new booklets and modify old entries. The analytics page shows trends in student performance over time.

This was created using Python with the Django framework, HTML/CSS, and Bootstrap.
